# Engineering Transparent Communication

As managers or leads of our teams, distilling complex concepts to others is a skill that helps us collaborate across disciplines and persuade others of our ideas. This is important in any field that requires specialized knowledge to be distributed to others; it's a crucial component in human knowledge sharing. It is also one of the competencies that I have often observed engineers struggle with the most. Whether you're delivering a technical demo to your internal stakeholders, speaking at a conference, or simply sharing a feature idea with your product manager, it's useful to understand why this skill can be difficult to master as well as ways to improve upon it.

The illusion of transparency is a cognitive bias in which people overestimate how much others understand their own mental state. They believe that their emotions and thoughts are more apparent to others than they actually are. This is a common occurrence in technical disciplines where the speaker assumes understanding of concepts and often fails to provide necessary context. In my experience, this is a common behavior anywhere specialized knowledge is being shared, but is especially prevalent and costly in software. 

Cross-team communication is occurring in each step of the software development cycle. So if we want to collaborate better and establish shared understanding, the question becomes, how can we work on this skill? And how can we encourage our teammates to work on this skill?

#### 1. Awareness of the bias

Informing yourself of a bias is the first step to removing it. As humans, we have access to our own thoughts and knowledge, but sometimes fail to remember that others don't have the same access. Keep this in the back of your mind the next time you're explaining more arcane knowledge. With awareness, you move the bias from an unconscious state to a conscious state, which is the only you can actually remove it. And you can help others be aware of this too. Notice when other teammates think that they are being obvious about something, but they are actually just using overly subtle hints. If a presentation is in progress and you notice an engineer making this mistake, gently call it out by saying "I'm not sure if others in the group understand that [insert technical concept here], could you please elaborate so we're all on the same page?".

#### 2. Consider your audience & reduce presumptions

Who is your audience? These can include product managers, project managers, other developers, and even end users of your product. Imagine how much information others might have about the topic that you're discussing *before* you communicate, i.e. don't assume how much they know. This requires foresight and some mental planning. When you start to explain a difficult concept, we start with what we already know. So make sure to take a few steps back from your explanation to what your specific audience already knows or accepts to be true.

#### 3. Get feedback & iterate on the presentation of information: 

If you're running a meeting and are required to convey technical information, ask feedback from people you trust after you're done. Since you will usually overestimate their ability to “read” your internal state, getting actual feedback can help you see just how much the illusion of transparency affects you, which will help you account for it better. You can do this throughout a meeting by checking for understanding, for example "Does how I explained the way our data is stored make sense? Is there some additional information you need?". Or at the end of the meeting, ask if information conveyed was sufficient to meet the objectives that were set. Favor simple explanations over complex ones. And while you're at it, slow down your explanations, and accept that it won't be a straightforward process to get to the point of full transparency amongst everyone.

#### Benefits

Once the awareness of this illusion is in place and we work to improve it, a multitude of benefits are available to us. Some of which include avoiding failures in the software development process, opening up new ideas and dialogue that wouldn't previously transpire, and more confidence from all stakeholders in the systems they are trying to build. It also makes it easier for cross-collaboration to occur among engineering, product, and design teams. All parties involved can also derive useful insights when information is transparent and clear to each person.

In terms of persuasion, if you're trying to convince the other party to build what you want or to steer in a different direction, it's helpful for each party to be clear about their intentions so that they feel like the situation is fair. If there's missing information or open questions, it can lead to a cascading set of problems. And if you convey information that the audience doesn't fully understand, you are less likely to have them buy into your idea.

As remote work starts to become more popular, it will become even more important to communicate ideas since a lot of information can be lost in the transfer over this medium.
You have an opportunity to improve the entirety of the software development process and enable stakeholders to feel more confident in the systems that are being developed by improving your communication skills.
