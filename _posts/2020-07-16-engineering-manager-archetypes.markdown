# The Right Fit

If you're out looking for your next organization, you probably have a slew of questions that you want to ask the company, especially for your hiring manager. Questions like what you'll be measured on, details around the project(s), and even the culture of the team. However, one area that I find a lot of engineers forget to ask about is what their engineering manager's tasks are like and what *they* will be measured on. After all, a manager can make or break your experience at a company, so it's worth probing what motivates them. The answers they provide will also give you insight into the organization that you'll be walking into.

Pat Kua's article on [5 Engineering Manager Archetypes]() really got me thinking about this, I'm using his archetypes below as a reference:

Questions to ask your new engineering manager:
* How much time do you spend coding day-to-day? [Tech EM]
* How do you stay abreast of new technologies? [Tech EM]
* Beyond 10:10s, what other ways that you help grow your team members? [Team EM]
* How do you resolve conflicts and dependencies on other teams? [Team EM]
* What are you expected to deliver on by the end of this quarter? Or after the iteration of a project? [Delivery EM]
* What is your relationship to the product managers within the company? How does Product & Engineering work together on a week-to-week or month-by-month basis? [Product EM]

As mentioned in Pat's article, all engineering managers have some degree of technical, people, delivery, and product skills. 
It's useful information for you as an interviewee to reframe interviews with these points in mind and ask specific questions of your manager.
