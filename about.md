My name is Tripta. I'm a software engineer. I have been living in the Bay Area for the past 8 years. My heart beats the brightest in Oakland.

I currently work on backend systems and Swift (gasp!) at Capital One. 

My interests include meditation (Theravada tradition), 💪 training, and 🏕️ with my husband.
