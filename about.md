My name is Tripta. I'm a software engineer working in San Francisco. I have been living in the Bay Area for the past almost 9 years. My heart beats the brightest in Oakland.

I currently work on backend systems with Java & Swift (gasp!) at Capital One. 

My interests include meditation (specifically of the Theravada tradition), strength training, and camping outdoors.
