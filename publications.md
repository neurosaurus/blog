[**Binding affinity and specificity of neuromyelitis optica autoantibodies to aquaporin-4 M1/M23 isoforms and orthogonal arrays.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21454592)<br>
Autoantibodies against astrocyte water channel aquaporin-4 (AQP4) are highly specific for the neuroinflammatory disease neuromyelitis optica (NMO). We measured the binding of NMO autoantibodies to AQP4 in human astrocyte-derived U87MG cells expressing M1 and/or M23 AQP4, or M23 mutants that do not form orthogonal array of particles (OAPs).<br>

[**Orthogonal array formation by human aquaporin-4: examination of neuromyelitis optica-associated aquaporin-4 polymorphisms.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621278)<br>
We analyzed the determinants of OAP formation by human AQP4 to investigate the possible role of polymorphisms in NMO pathogenesis. NMO-associated mutations R19I and R19T in AQP4 did not affect OAP assembly, palmitoylation-dependent regulation of assembly, or NMO autoantibody binding. Residue-19 polymorphisms in AQP4 are thus unlikely to be disease relevant.<br>

[**Patterns of neural activity associated with differential acute locomotor stimulation to cocaine and methamphetamine in adolescent versus adult male C57BL/6J mice.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19932887)<br>
We used a mouse model in which adolescents display dramatically reduced sensitivity to the acute locomotor stimulating effects of cocaine and methamphetamine. The goal was to identify key brain regions or circuits involved in the differential behavior.<br>

[**Evaluation of a pharmacokinetic hypothesis for reduced locomotor stimulation from methamphetamine and cocaine in adolescent versus adult male C57BL/6J mice.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18797848)<br>
The primary aim of the current study is to test a possible pharmacokinetic explanation for the attenuated locomotor stimulation seen in adolescents. A secondary aim is to extend the current literature for acute methamphetamine in adolescents.<br>

[**Acute Effects of Acamprosate and MPEP on Ethanol Drinking-in-the-Dark in Male C57BL/6J Mice.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18782337)<br>
Recently, a simple procedure in mice, Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID), was hypothesized to have value for medication development for human alcoholism. In DID, mice are offered intermittent, limited access to ethanol over a series of days during the dark phase that results in rapid drinking to intoxication in predisposed genotypes. We measured the effects of acamprosate or MPEP, metabotropic glutamate 5 receptor (mGluR5) antagonist, on intake of 20% ethanol, plain tap water or 10% sugar water using the DID procedure in male C57BL/6J mice.<br>

[**Acute effects of Naltrexone and GBR 12909 on ethanol drinking-in-the-dark in C57BL/6J mice.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17273875)<br>
To determine whether the model displays predictive validity with naltrexone, and whether opioid or dopaminergic mechanisms mediate excessive drinking in the model.<br>
